It's now also possible to change software sources, update maually and search with increased performance along with many other improvements.

GNOME 3.12 also brings a new gedit with an overhauled user interface. The new minimalistic user interface helps you focus on the task at hand, while preserving all the features you need in a text editor.

Videos has similarly gained a new face along with new features.
Through Videos it is now possible to browse your local library and watch videos in the new playback view. Also, browsing through streaming videos from a number of web services is now possible directly from the new slick user interface.

With Web, browsing content on the internet is now also possible much more elegantly through the new interface. Finding a website you visited before, or downloading content to your computer has aethetically improved to enhance your experience without getting in the way of your work.

For developers, we quite a lot of news as well. GNOME 3.12 includes many improvements that will make it easier to integrate your app with GNOME and other desktop environments. Improvements has been made to various APIs, primarily the GSubprocess API which has become a lot more powerful and GNotification which has received a whole new API for desktop notification support.

GTK3 has also received new components such as the GtkFlowBox, GtkActionBar and GtkPopover. These will give you new possibilities for creating a great user experience and make your app that much more awesome.

Alongside the new internal changes, the documentation that you rely on has also received an overhaul in look as well as in content. These changes aims at increasing your productivity just like the new search provider for your favorite Terminal commands.
